# Deqo’s Project: Real-Time Health Data in Somalia

## **Emerging Talent 6 - Collaborative Data Science Project (CDSP)**

This project is part of a collaborative data science initiative where we aim to create meaningful solutions aligned with pressing health needs in Somalia.

We are a team of aspiring data scientists designing a real-time health data platform that enables Somali health workers to input daily patient information, transforming it into live dashboards and maps. The system supports early outbreak detection, monitoring of chronic conditions, and informed resource allocation to underserved areas.

## 🌍 Project Overview

**Title:** Real-Time Health Data Platform for Somalia.

**Summary:**
We are designing a system for Somali health workers to enter daily patient data, which is then processed into real-time maps and dashboards.

This system aims to:

- Detect outbreaks early
- Track chronic disease trends
- Support data-informed decision-making for communities and government

**📌 Current Status:**

We are currently working on an MVP version of the platform, with a specific focus on maternal health — particularly **postpartum infections and their correlation with maternal mortality in Somalia.** The project scope has been defined, along with the research question and the identification of an initial dataset to support our investigation.

## 🎯 Problem Identification

### Design Thinking Process

#### **🧠 Phase I: Divergent Thinking**

We began by exploring the state of healthcare in Somalia through statistical data and academic research, which revealed several critical areas of concern. Based on these findings, *we identified three key health pillars to investigate further:*

- Infectious Diseases
- Non-Communicable Diseases
- Child Vaccination & Mortality

These pillars reflected both the pressing health challenges in Somalia and  potential core interests for Deqo’s dashboard and hospital in addressing underserved communities.

---

#### **🎯 Phase II: Convergent Thinking**

We narrowed our focus to Maternal Health, driven by its immediate urgency (maternal mortality rates in Somalia are among the **highest** in the world!) and the availability of relevant data. Using synthesis techniques, we developed one central research question supported by multiple sub-questions. We also validated our direction by aligning it with Deqo’s dashboard vision and Somalia’s national healthcare priorities

Read more about the Iceberg Model that we used to uncover **systemic issues** underlying maternal health outcomes.

#### 🔍 Research Focus

**Main Research Question:**

> What are the patterns of postpartum infections among Somali women who
> do not receive postnatal care within 2 days of delivery, and how do
> these patterns correlate with maternal mortality outcomes?

**Sub-Questions:**

- Can we identify infection-mortality pathways outside formal healthcare systems?
- Do seasonal or environmental factors like floods or malaria prevalence increase postpartum risks?
- Are there geographic hotspots of postpartum infections?
- What’s the true burden of infection-related maternal mortality in non-facility settings?
- How does the age of FGM influence maternal and neonatal outcomes?

## 🗓️ Project Timeline

 Our project has undergone several iterative cycles as we navigated challenges and refined our approach to stay aligned with our mission. The current timeline centers on completing the research phase focused on maternal health. Following this, an additional sprint will be launched to explore how Deqo's clinic data can be integrated and leveraged using the insights derived from this research.
