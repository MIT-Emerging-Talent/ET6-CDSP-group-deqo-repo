## Communication Channels

How often we will get in touch on each channel, and what we will discuss there:

- **Issues**: Used continuously to track tasks, bugs, planning, and team
  contributions. Preferably, each task should has its own issue with clear
acceptance criteria and format.
- **Pull Requests**: Created whenever a task is ready for review. Used for
  technical discussion, code/doc review, and decisions on whether something is
ready to merge. PRs should be reviewed by at least one team member within 1–2
days. All suggested changes should be made using the review tools
( inline comments or suggestions mode).
- **Slack/WhatsApp**: Used daily for quick check-ins, informal updates, and
  coordination. Also used for reminders or schedule updates.
- **Notion**: Used to share and organize documents and resources.
- **Video Calls**: Weekly, used for deeper discussions, brainstorming sessions,
and resolving complex issues.

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes and
stubbornly getting nowhere. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you’ve been stuck on the same problem:

1. *0 → 30 min*: Try on your own
2. *30 → 60 min*: Ask your group for help
3. *60+ min*: Tag your coaches in Slack, WhatsApp or GitHub
