respectful, purposeful, and efficient way. It reflects both the practical and
human aspects of collaboration... Because great work needs both checklists and
care.

## 💬 Communication

- Communicate clearly, honestly, and frequently.
  Transparency keeps us in sync and aligned

for our real-time magic ~
see our [Communication Guide](./communication.md) for details.
- Choose meeting times together and respect each other's schedules  

## 🤝 Collaboration

Our goal is inclusive participation and thoughtful engagement

- Document decisions and progress clearly so the story of our work is traceable
- Use discussion to explore ideas and respectful debate to make decisions
- Align collaboration with our shared intentions ~ see our [Learning Goals](./learning-goals.md).

## 🌱 Feedback & Trust

- Feedback is meant to improve the work, not to judge individuals
- Build cognitive trust with accountability, and affective trust with empathy

## 🧩 Task Management

- Assign and claim tasks clearly via GitHub or shared tools  
- Provide updates at least once a week to keep everyone aligned
- Support each other with shared learning and encouragement
- Respect deadlines and communicate early if delays arise, our reliability
  builds trust

## 🛠️ Conflict Resolution

- We aim to restore damaged trust through accountability and consistent actions

We're building something together ~ with code, with care, and with each other.  
We value communication that's clear, feedback that's kind, and work that's accountable.

And yes, we agree to all this voluntarily, no bribes of coffee or cookies were
involved... probably. ☕🍪
