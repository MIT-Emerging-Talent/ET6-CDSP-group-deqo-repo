# Domain Research: Postpartum Infections and Maternal Mortality in Somalia

## Introduction and Overview

Somalia grapples with one of the world's most severe maternal health crises,
with maternal mortality ratios (MMR) that remain among the highest globally.
Recent estimates for 2023 place the MMR at 563 deaths per 100,000 live births
(2, 4), while other reports cite figures as high as 621 deaths per 100,000 live
births in 2020 (1). While the MMR has seen a decline from 1,465 in 2000 to
these recent figures, this progress is insufficient to meet the Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) target of fewer than 70 deaths by 2030 (2). The primary
causes of maternal mortality are largely preventable, including postpartum
hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, and pregnancy-related infections (sepsis)
(4, 13). The country's decades-long civil conflict, political instability,
and recurring humanitarian emergencies like droughts and floods have
profoundly weakened its healthcare system, leading to limited access to
essential services and a critical shortage of skilled health professionals
(6, 7). This fragility is a major contributor to the high risk of postpartum
infections and subsequent maternal deaths, particularly in non-facility
settings.

## The Urban-Rural Divide and Access to Care

The risk of maternal mortality and postpartum infections in Somalia is heavily
determined by geographic location. In rural and underdeveloped areas,
communities have significantly less access to healthcare services, which are
concentrated in towns and cities (8). Nationally, only 32% of births occur in
health facilities (9), with much lower rates in rural regions. This disparity
means that rural women are more likely to deliver at home under unsanitary
conditions, lack antenatal and postnatal care, and experience dangerous delays
in accessing emergency obstetric services (8). The Bay region around Baidoa is
a notable example of an area facing extreme vulnerability due to poverty, long
distances to healthcare, and insecurity (4). In contrast, urban areas like
Mogadishu have better, though still insufficient, maternal health indicators,
with 30% facility births and 13% of women receiving postnatal checks within
two days (12).

## Key Risk Factors and Infection Pathways

A significant, pervasive factor exacerbating postpartum infection risk is the
near-universal practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), especially Type III
infibulation (1). This practice, often performed in childhood, has long-term
implications, predisposing women to severe obstetric complications like
prolonged and obstructed labor, a higher need for C-sections, and a
significantly increased susceptibility to infections (1).

The "three delays" model effectively explains why infections often become fatal
outside the healthcare system:

1. **Delay in deciding to seek care**: This is driven by socio-cultural norms,
male-dominated decision-making, and a general mistrust of formal medical care
(13).
2. **Delay in reaching a health facility**: This is a direct result of poor
transportation infrastructure, insecurity, and the high cost of travel (4).
3. **Delay in receiving adequate care**: Even when a woman reaches a facility,
she may face staff shortages, a lack of essential medicines, and poor infection
control (4).

Additionally, maternal malnutrition is widespread, with over 20% of women
classified as thin, which weakens their immune systems and makes them more
susceptible to postpartum infections (1).

## Environmental and Seasonal Factors

Seasonal and environmental factors act as major multipliers of vulnerability,
creating predictable patterns of postpartum risk. The survey paper highlights
the high prevalence of infectious diseases, which directly correlates with
environmental conditions:

- **Rainy seasons and floods**: These can damage infrastructure, restrict
mobility, and increase exposure to waterborne diseases like cholera and vector-
borne illnesses like malaria (14). A mother giving birth during a flood is at a
higher risk of contracting these diseases, which can severely worsen her
postpartum health.
- **Dry seasons and droughts**: These lead to reduced food security and
malnutrition, which weakens a mother's immune system and makes her more
susceptible to infections (3, 4, 5). Droughts can also force population
migration, further limiting access to timely postnatal care (5, 10).

## Data and Geographic Hotspots

The true burden of infection-related maternal mortality in Somalia's non-
facility settings remains largely unquantified. The survey paper confirms that
Somalia's health data is "extremely fragmented and limited" due to the absence
of a comprehensive national vital registration system (1, 10). The reliance on
verbal autopsies means many deaths in communities never enter official
statistics, obscuring the scale of the problem. However, recent reports from the
Ministry of Health show a 95% reporting rate from public health facilities,
indicating some progress in data collection, though data from private hospitals
remains a challenge (15).

Despite these data gaps, a few geographic "hotspots" for postpartum infection-
related deaths can be identified:

- **Bay and Bakool regions**: These areas are characterized by long distances to
health facilities, high poverty, and recurrent conflict (4).
- **Rural Somaliland**: This region has a high rate of home deliveries (69.19%)
and minimal skilled birth attendance (10).
- **Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps**: These camps, such as those in
Mogadishu and Baidoa, are often overcrowded and have poor water and sanitation
conditions, leading to heightened disease transmission and infection risk (10).

This complex interplay of social, political, and environmental factors
demonstrates that improving maternal health in Somalia requires a holistic
approach that addresses not only healthcare delivery but also the underlying
systemic vulnerabilities.
