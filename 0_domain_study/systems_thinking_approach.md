## üìå Events: What just happened?

- Mother experiences prolonged labor ‚Üí requires emergency caesarean section; baby born with low birth weight or birth asphyxia; possible stillbirth.

- FGM mother with FGM-related scarring ‚Üíobstructed/prolonged labor and PPH, neonatal distress.

- Newborn/children presents with measles , fever, diarrhea, or ARI/respiratory symptoms

- Child (0‚Äì5) unvaccinated/zero-dose increasing susceptibility to preventable illness and higher mortality.

- Low ANC use and missed postnatal checks at the point of need.

## üìà Pattern / Trend: What has been happening over time?

- Persistently high maternal mortality (‚âà563/100,000) and neonatal mortality (‚âà36/1,000), with neonatal deaths >33% of under-5 deaths.

- Female genital mutilation remains nearly universal (‚âà99%), typically performed by traditional practitioners rather than health professionals, which increases risks of infection, poor healing, and severe obstetric complications later in life.
- Low antenatal care (ANC) and postnatal care (PNC) coverage in Somalia ‚Üí many maternal complications and neonatal conditions (low birth weight, infections, prematurity) go undetected or untreated.
- Only about 32% of births attended by skilled health personnel, limiting timely management of complications.

- Low/full-series vaccination coverage; large zero-dose cohort (~44%) ‚Üí recurrent measles, diarrhea, respiratory infections clusters.
- Neonatal morbidity and mortality patterns: reports of low birth weight, acute respiratory infections, and neonatal deaths in facilities and communities.

## üèóÔ∏è Structure: What are the rules, policies, and institutions contributing to the situation?

- Low ANC and PNC coverage: only about 31% of women received any antenatal care (up from 26% in 2006), and just 11% received postnatal care, unchanged from 2006 levels.

- Barriers to seeking care: the main reasons Somali women do not attend ANC or PNC include:Lack of money, Long distances to health facilities, Need for permission from family members to seek care.

- Weak maternal & newborn care systems: Only ~32% of births attended by skilled personnel; reliance on unregulated traditional birth attendants (TBAs).

- Informal and harmful practices: FGM is mainly performed by traditional practitioners, outside the health system.

- Data and governance gaps: underdeveloped health information systems, and little geographic mapping of neonatal mortality/morbidity hotspots.

- Inequities: Wealth, urban‚Äìrural, and regional disparities concentrate under-5 morbidity/mortality .

## üí≠ Mental Models: What beliefs and values keep the system in place?

- FGM cultural norms: Seen as a rite of passage, prerequisite for marriage, and a marker of purity/honor ‚Üí perpetuating near-universal practice despite health risks.

- Vaccines skepticism/low perceived benefit

- Preference for traditional providers over formal services ‚Üí missed ANC/PNC and delayed referral.

- The belief that ‚Äúhealthcare costs are unaffordable‚Äù persists‚Äîeven when some services are free, indirect costs (transport, permission, time off work) reinforce avoidance

- Cultural trust in traditional providers:TBAs and traditional circumcisers (for FGM) are trusted figures, deeply embedded in community norms. This delays or displaces engagement with formal care systems‚Äîeven when complications arise.
