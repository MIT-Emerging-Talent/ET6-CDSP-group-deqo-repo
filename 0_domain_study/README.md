# Research overview

This project will investigate the status of maternal and child health (0‚Äì5 years) with a focus on neonatal health in Somalia. The study is divided into two main parts: the first examines maternal health in Somalia, while the second focuses on the health of children under five years of age. Together, these two components aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current challenges and opportunities for improving health outcomes for mothers and young children in Somalia.

## Background

### Maternal Health

Somalia currently has one of the highest maternal mortality ratios globally, with recent estimates placing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) between 563 and 692 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Despite some progress over the past two decades, mortality reductions have been slow and maternal outcomes continue to lag behind global targets. A principal contributor to this high maternal mortality is female genital mutilation (FGM), a deeply entrenched practice affecting a majority of women in Somalia with nearly 99% of Somali women aged 15‚Äì49 have undergone it. predominantly the severe Type III (infibulation). FGM significantly heightens the risk of severe obstetric complications, including but not limited to postpartum hemorrhage, obstructed and prolonged labor, and an increased likelihood of emergency caesarean section. These adverse effects are compounded by limited access to skilled birth attendants and institutional delivery, with only about 21‚Äì32% of births attended by trained professionals in Somalia. FGM-related scarring, fibrosis, and inelasticity of the genital tissues are known to contribute to life-threatening childbirth complications requiring emergency interventions.

The health risks of FGM extend beyond the mother, profoundly impacting neonatal health. Babies born to mothers with FGM face higher risks of birth asphyxia, stillbirth, and require more frequent neonatal intensive care. Notably, recent studies indicate that infants born to women who have undergone FGM are almost twice as likely to have an Apgar score below 7 at five minutes. Inadequate maternal healthcare, high prevalence of FGM, and systemic barriers together perpetuate these neonatal health challenges.

### Child‚Äôs Health

The under-five mortality rate is estimated at 115 deaths per 1,000 live births (2021 UN estimates), and neonatal mortality accounts for a third of these deaths, more than double the global average. Vaccination rates are low: Recent studies show that only about 20%‚Äì55% of children receive all necessary vaccines; nearly 44% of children aged 12‚Äì23 months receive no routine vaccines (zero-dose). Leading causes of death: respiratory infections, diarrhoea, measles, and malnutrition.
Moreover, preterm infants and those with very low birth weight are at substantial risk. Respiratory infections and diarrhoea, remain persistent threats. Major risk factors for neonatal illness and death include inadequate antenatal care, poverty, low birth weight, and limited access to emergency obstetric and neonatal interventions.

## Problem Statement

Somalia continues to face one of the world‚Äôs highest burdens of maternal and child mortality, with maternal mortality estimated at 563‚Äì692 deaths per 100,000 live births and under-five mortality at 115 deaths per 1,000 live births.with a neonatal mortality rate of 35 per 1,000‚Äîmore than double the global average of 17. Maternal health complications are a major driver: nearly 99% of Somali women undergo female genital mutilation, predominantly Type III, which increases the risk of prolonged labor, obstructed delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, and emergency caesarean section. These factors contribute to high rates of stillbirth, birth asphyxia, and low birth weight, worsening outcomes for neonates.

Beyond the perinatal period, Somali children face persistent threats from measles, diarrheal diseases, and respiratory infections, compounded by malnutrition. Vaccination coverage remains critically low, with 44% of children aged 12‚Äì23 months receiving no routine immunizations. Together, these maternal and child health challenges underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to reduce preventable deaths and improve survival in Somalia.However, little is known about how these burdens are distributed geographically across the country, limiting the ability to target interventions where the need is greatest.

Addressing these evidence gaps‚Äîboth in understanding FGM‚Äôs role in maternal and children health outcomes and in identifying geographic hotspots of neonatal mortality and morbidity‚Äîis essential for designing targeted, high-impact interventions.

### Research Process Overview

#### üîπ Divergence (Exploration phase)

We began by exploring the available data on Somalia‚Äôs health status. Our initial challenge was Somalia‚Äôs long-standing data drought, where for nearly three decades little to no nationally representative health data was available. This gap was addressed by the Somalia Health and Demographic Survey (SHDS) 2020, which became a cornerstone resource, effectively ending this 30-year data drought.
Using the SHDS dataset, we carried out broad exploratory research into multiple dimensions of Somalia‚Äôs health, including:

- Maternal health and reproductive health outcomes

- Child health, particularly children under five

- Gender-based violence (GBV)

- Chronic diseases and non-communicable conditions

- Nutritional status and malnutrition patterns

Through this exploratory (divergent) process, we gained a wide understanding of Somalia‚Äôs key health burdens and identified major knowledge gaps.

#### üîπ Convergence (Focusing phase)

After systematically reviewing these domains, we narrowed our focus to maternal and under 5 children health, given their persistently high mortality rates and the critical impact of practices such as female genital mutilation (FGM) on outcomes.
Hence we came up with these questions

## Research Questions

This research aims to:

1. Assess the impact of FGM on maternal and neonatal outcomes in Somalia, and
2. Map and analyze national patterns and geographic hotspots of children under 5 mortality and morbidity throughout Somalia.
