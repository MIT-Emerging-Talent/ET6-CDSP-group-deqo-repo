# Retrospective

## ✨ Team Vibe Check

Faced with silence on some questions, we decided not to wait.  
We shifted from trying to cover every healthcare angle…… to designing a focused MVP.  

---

## Project Pivot & Evolution

- **Initial Focus**: We began with the goal of exploring a broad,
multi-faceted approach to healthcare challenges in Somalia
- **What Changed**: Due to time limitations and lack of concrete
guidance from our partner, we recognized the need to narrow our scope
- **The Shift**: We pivoted toward developing a Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
- **How We Adapted**: The team split into three subgroups aligned around core pillars,
engaged in intensive brainstorming,
and converged on a shared problem definition before moving outward from there

---

## Stop Doing

- Setting internal check-in points for scope alignment

## Continue Doing

- Supporting each other with consistent communication
- Embracing flexibility when plans shift
- Brainstorming and building ideas collaboratively

## Start Doing

- Relying heavily on external answers before taking initiative
- Trying to cover too many aspects of the problem space at once
- Waiting for "perfect clarity" before moving forward

## Lessons Learned

- Time constraints can sharpen focus and fuel creative problem-solving

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Initial roles and group structures were set up effectively
- We organized ourselves and prepared to move forward based on that understanding

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- We initially assumed our scope was fully defined  
- Some essential questions remained unanswered despite our efforts to seek clarification
- That ambiguity slowed down early momentum  

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Yes, we shifted to an independent strategy based on collective brainstorming and domain understanding
- We restructured into three subgroups, each exploring a core pillar to broaden our perspective
- This shift allowed us to regain momentum and make progress based on internal insights

### Or remove extra steps?

- The attempt to cover too many healthcare areas at once  
- Certain partner-dependent deliverables that lacked clarity

> I came into this milestone lost in the fog. My biggest contribution... Asking too many questions and trying to organize the chaos; notes, agendas, structure. I struggled to catch up, and the chosen path wasn't what I'd hoped for... I felt unchallegned, but I learned that focused beats flashy

> This milestone is one of the defining steppingstones of the project. Going through this stage was the most challengeing so far for our team as there's a lot of back and forth in the way we want to structure ourselves to work on a mission with two goals, learn how to work on a collaborative data science project as a team and also help a stakeholder reach specific goals using data. I'm glad we fimally reached some middle ground to be able to meet the two goals at the same time.
