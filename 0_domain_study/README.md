## Our Research Questions

1-Are there geographic hotspots where neonatal mortality and morbidity cluster?

2-How does the severity at which FGM ( Female Genital Mutilation) is performed influence
maternal and neonatal health outcomes?

3-Are there disparities in neonatal mortality linked to socio-political
instability (e.g., conflict zones vs. stable regions)?
