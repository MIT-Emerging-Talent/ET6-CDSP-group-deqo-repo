# Retrospective

## Team Vibe Check ðŸ˜Ž

**DÃ©jÃ  Vu Edition**
Apparently, one run wasn't enough... So we hit replay! Everyone got to run the show twice: solo acts in our groups, then the big group remix.

## Stop Doing

## Continue Doing

- Open technical discussions and collaborative planning, they helped align goals across teams.

- Work openly on strategies that allow us to streamline the process and make it clear to others.

## Start Doing

## Lessons Learned

- Given our data limitations, being flexible and creative with alternative approaches helped us move forward successfully.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- We managed to define a focused research question and outline a basic analysis plan.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- We couldn't initially access the specific data we needed to follow our original plan.
- While our project was originally designed to depend largely on Deqo's data, weâ€™re remaining flexible and exploring alternative approaches as the situation evolves

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- We had to develop new strategies to keep our objectives on track.

### Or remove extra steps?

- We simplified our initial analytical approach while waiting to secure the necessary data.

## Individual Rerospectives

### Name

### Ava

> Repeating the process felt somewhat repetitive at first. However, the opportunity to engage with new colleagues from the other group, and to reconnect with my own team, transformed the experience into something genuinely rewarding.

### Ana

- Itâ€™s been a challenge for me to define clear  methodological next steps and task priorities, but Iâ€™ve learned a lot from my teammates and their leadership. Strong teamwork has been key to keeping both groups aligned and making real progress.

### Rafaa

Transferring to this active group was a great experience.
The collaborative brainstorming and individual summaries of different aspects of Somali healthcare,made complex topics much easier to grasp. I also gained valuable knowledge in a short time.

### Martha

Iâ€™ve been slower to contribute than I hoped, as defining clear methodological steps has been more challenging than expected. Still, Iâ€™ve stayed engaged and learned a lot by observing my teammatesâ€™ strong leadership and clarity.
Their momentum has sharpened my focus, and Iâ€™m ready to step up and contribute with renewed direction.

### Reem

At first, I was deeply excited about contributing to a meaningful cause through this project. However, things turned out to be quite different from what I expected, which brought several challenges, especially in terms of taking initiative and guiding the team forward. Itâ€™s been a learning experience, and while it hasnâ€™t been easy, I remain hopeful that weâ€™ll continue growing as a team  and that things will come together in the end.
