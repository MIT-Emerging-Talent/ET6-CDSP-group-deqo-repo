# ðŸ“š Learning Goals

## ðŸŽ¯ Collective Learning Goals

As a team, we aim to:

- Strengthen our understanding of core data science concepts and workflows.
- Develop hands-on technical skills in health data handling, from cleaning and structuring to analysis and modeling.
- Apply statistical and machine learning methods to identify patterns in real-world healthcare datasets.
- Build capacity in visualizing data to communicate findings clearly and impactfully.
- Collaborate more effectively and naturally, encouraging initiative and shared leadership.
- Use data-driven insights to support decision-making and improve healthcare outcomes, especially in underserved regions like Somalia.
- Stay rooted in purpose, ensuring our work serves people and remains connected to the human side of data science.

## ðŸ™‹ Individual Learning Goals

### **Solara**

> I aim to develop the ability to implement analytical models using Python and libraries such as Pandas to analyze health data to uncover associations between risk factors and health outcomes.  
> Additionally, I want to be able to create compelling, engaging data visualizations and effectively communicate my findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

---

### **Reem Osama**

> I want to learn more about the applications of machine learning in data exploration to answer a scientific question and get hands-on experience with that.

---

### **Martha Y. Nyekanga**

> - Apply data science techniques to solve issues in real-life cases.  
> - Go through each part of an algorithm carefully to grasp how and why it works.  
> - Get comfortable setting research questions and exploring data to make informed decisions.

---

### **Rafaa**

> I want to build a solid foundation in data science and enhance my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex health data.

---

### **Ana Isabel Murillo**

> I want to improve my ability to manage health data pipelines, select appropriate analytical methods, and apply them using Python and relevant libraries.  
> I'm also aiming to deepen my understanding of how to turn technical results into actionable insights for real-world health challenges.
