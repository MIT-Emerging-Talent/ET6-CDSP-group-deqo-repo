- Final deliverables should meet Dego’s expectations with a realistic vision of satisfaction.

- We are waiting to hear back from Dego for further input, including her location details.

- We will review data from the 2020 Somalia research, focusing on environments similar to Dego’s clinic areas, to extract insights and identify trends in healthcare and outbreaks.

- A clear research question will be defined after receiving input from Dego.

- Reem will create a Notion page for planning.

### ***Next Steps***

- [ ] All: Send your email addresses for meeting invites.

- [ ] Reem: Set up the Notion workspace.

## 📅 **Meeting** 1.5: Exploratory Meeting

**Date:** Tuesday July 24th

## **Main Topics**

- Brief overview of the Malnutrition topic

- Data availability and usage proposal

- Questions for Evan

## **Discussions**

- The team feels a bit behind in project progress and would like more guidance, particularly regarding the upcoming ****panel presentation

- Lack of accessible data was highlighted. Suggested solutions included:

- Using online datasets for training the model

- Using Deqo's data for testing/validation

- But we still need answers from Deqo (e.g. what data do they collect?)

- **Iceberg Model** for communicating topic insights

- A full team meeting will take place tomorrow (25/07/2025) to discuss all topics more thoroughly

- The **weekly meeting time may need to change** to better accommodate all members' availability

## **Decisions**

- Full project discussion to take place in the next meeting

- Suggestions for new time slots to be discussed

## **Questions for Evan**

1. Can Deqo involve more active members from her staff to support project work?

2. Can you join tomorrow's meeting to provide additional guidance, especially on the panel presentation?

## 📅 Meeting 2: All-Topics Table

**Date:** Friday, July 25th

## **Main Topics**

- Refining the main research question

- Finalizing topic focus

- Understanding survey paper purpose and structure

- Data status and next steps

- Task distribution and repo preparation

- Scheduling quick check-in

- **Preparing for panel presentation**

## **Discussions**

- Attendees agreed to narrow the project scope to **non-communicable diseases (NCDs), infectious diseases**, and **child mortality/vaccination**, with the aim of connecting these themes under one coherent research direction

- There was a strong **emphasis on defining a central research question** that integrates the three themes and reflects **Deqo's priorities**

- Clarified the purpose of the **survey paper**: Summarizes and analyzes existing research on a specific topic. It doesn’t introduce new data but gives an overview of what people already researched , highlights key findings, and points out research gaps. It’s useful to give a grasp about what have been happening over time regarding the research and projects in specific area for instance, Somalia’s health care system.

- **Data limitations** remain a major barrier.

- **Muhammed** will share whatever datasets he can access.

- Still pending: clear understanding from **Deqo** about what’s available internally)

- Agreed to **define GitHub repo tasks** and delegate individual responsibilities across members

- Confirmed a **check-in meeting on Monday** to share progress, review data availability, and continue refining the research design

## **Decisions**

- Draft initial version of the survey paper structure

- Muhammed to share dataset

- Repo setup to begin this week, with clear task assignments per member

- **Next full check-in**: Monday meeting

## 📅 Meeting 2.1: **Research Direction Meeting**

**Date:** Monday July 28th

## **Main Topics**

- Finalize the main research question and overall study focus.

- Group structure: One joint project vs. multiple subgroup projects

## **Discussions**

### Research Structure Options

The team discussed two potential approaches:

**Option 1:** One Research Question → One Project

1. Focused on one central health topic, with related sub-questions

2. All members contribute to a unified study

 🟢 Pros:

 1. Easier to coordinate

 2. More achievable given current activity and capacity

**Option 2:** Multiple Research Questions **→** Subgroup Projects

1. Each subgroup tackles the main health issue from a distinct angle

2. Subgroups work semi-independently

 🟢 Pros:

 1. Reflects the 3 research subgroups already formed

 2. Matches Deqo’s vision for a comprehensive dashboard

 3. Allows thematic depth across different health pillars

## **Decisions**

Majority voted to pursue **one core research question** with related sub-questions rather than multiple separate topics

> **→ Research Focus:** Entire group will collaborate on one project

## **Selected Research Question**

**“What are the patterns of postpartum infections among Somali women who do not receive postnatal care within 2 days of delivery, and how do these patterns correlate with maternal mortality outcomes?”**

### Proposed Sub-Questions

1. Can we identify infection-mortality pathways that occur outside the healthcare system?

2. Do seasonal or environmental factors create predictable postpartum risk patterns (e.g., flood/dry seasons, malaria prevalence, birth dates)?

3. Are there geographic hotspots where postpartum infections cluster?

4. What is the true burden of infection-related maternal mortality in non-facility settings?

> **Note:** The research question and sub-questions are open for suggestions and feedback until **Tuesday evening**

</aside>

## **Next Steps**

- [ ] **Data Source:** Begin exploring the **Somali Demographic and Health Survey (SDHS)** dataset

- [ ] Team members are encouraged to **suggest additional data sources or relevant proxies** to support the sub-questions

- [ ] **Next Meeting → Wednesday 10:00 AM EST**

**Agenda:**

- Delegate specific tasks for data exploration and sub-question ownership

- Discuss presentation content, assign presenters

- Plan slide development based on findings
