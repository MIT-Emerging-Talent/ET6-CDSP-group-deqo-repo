## Dataset Title

[Somalia Demography and Householding Survey](https://microdata.nbs.gov.so/index.php/catalog/50/data-dictionary)

## Source & Acquisition

### **Source Organization / Author**

The Somali Health and Demographic Survey (SHDS) 2020 was produced by the **Somali National Bureau of Statistics (SNBS)**, under the Federal Government of Somalia, with technical support from the **Ministry of Health FGS**, **Ministries of Health and Planning of Federal Member States (FMS)**, and **UNFPA Somalia**. Funding was provided by DFID (UK), Sweden, Finland, Italy, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.

### **Link or Access Point**

The microdata are available through the SNBS microdata portal: you can access them via the **Get Microdata** section for SHDS 2020 in their catalog.  

Supplementary materials including national reports, questionnaires, technical documentation, and metadata can be found on the **UNFPA Somalia SHDS 2020**  

### **Date Acquired**

While the dataset was created on **September 6, 2021**, and last modified on **July 21, 2023**, it was publicly accessed by researchers (e.g., for a study published in early 2025) as of **May 1, 2024**

### **Version / Release Date**

The reference ID for the dataset is **SOM-SNBS-SHDS-2020-v01**. The official report was published on **April 30, 2020**

### **Licensing / Usage Restrictions**

The SHDS 2020 microdata are available for legitimate academic and policy research upon registration on the SNBS microdata portal (name, affiliation, email, country required). Usage is subject to SNBS terms and likely confidential, but broadly available for research purposes. No explicit open license was listed in the metadata, so internal policies apply.  

## Purpose & Relevance

The SHDS 2020 was selected for its rich, nationally and sub-nationally representative data on **neonatal health, child morbidity, and mortality**, as well as demographic, geographic, and healthcare utilization indicators.

- It includes mortality variables (e.g., child alive or dead at time of interview, age at death) critical for quantifying neonatal mortality and morbidity variables (diarrhea, fever, cough/respiratory distress), enabling robust measurement of neonatal health outcomes.  
- **Maternal Health & FGM**: The dataset contains detailed maternal health indicators, including antenatal care, delivery care, postnatal care, and female genital mutilation (FGM) prevalence and type. Since FGM has been associated with obstructed labor, postpartum hemorrhage, and higher risk of neonatal asphyxia or mortality, SHDS offers a unique opportunity to assess how maternal practices and complications (linked to FGM) influence neonatal survival and morbidity.  
- **Geographic & Sociocultural Context**: The dataset is stratified by region, urban/rural residence, and displacement settings, making it possible to detect geographic clusters of poor maternal and neonatal health outcomes, while also exploring the sociocultural role of FGM prevalence.  

## Limitations & Caveats  

While SHDS 2020 is one of the most comprehensive surveys available for Somalia, several limitations should be acknowledged when interpreting results:  

1. **Complex Subdivisions and Sampling Challenges**  
   - Overlapping definitions of “region,” “urban/rural,” and “displacement settings” complicate comparability.  
   - Security concerns and access restrictions in some areas may have influenced coverage.  

2. **Recall Bias**  
   - Many variables (e.g., illness, mortality, care-seeking) rely on maternal recall, which may introduce error.  
   - Sensitive practices (e.g., FGM type, complications) may be underreported.  

3. **Cultural and Reporting Bias**  
   - Topics like FGM, child deaths, and maternal complications may be underreported due to stigma or sensitivity.  

4. **Mortality and Morbidity Measurement**  
   - Household-level retrospective reporting can misestimate neonatal mortality.  
   - Age at death is sometimes imprecisely recorded.  

5. **Temporal Relevance**  
   - Data collection was in 2019–2020, and may not fully capture post-2020 health shocks (e.g., drought, pandemic).  

6. **Missing Data and Nonresponse**  
   - Certain indicators (especially maternal health and FGM) show missing or “don’t know” responses.  

7. **Generalizability Limits**  
   - While nationally representative, estimates for nomadic, displaced, or marginalized groups may be less robust.  

## Ethical Considerations  

- **Privacy**: The dataset contains sensitive demographic and health-related variables. Personally identifiable information (PII) is excluded from the public-use files, but strict data protection protocols should be followed.  
- **Consent**: Data collection for SHDS 2020 was conducted with informed consent from participants. Accessing the microdata requires signing up on the [Somali National Bureau of Statistics (SNBS) website](https://microdata.nbs.gov.so/index.php/catalog/50/study-description), which ensures that researchers acknowledge and comply with usage conditions.  
- **Bias & Representation**: Despite national representativeness, some groups (e.g., nomadic, displaced, or conflict-affected populations) may be underrepresented, and cultural sensitivity around FGM, child mortality, or maternal health may lead to reporting bias.  
- **Transparency**: Metadata, survey tools, and documentation are made available by SNBS and UNFPA, enhancing reproducibility. Researchers should explicitly disclose methods, acknowledge limitations, and apply culturally sensitive interpretations of findings.
