**Title:** Real-Time Health Data Platform for Somalia.

**Summary:**
We are designing a system for Somali health workers to enter daily patient data,
which is then processed into real-time maps and dashboards.
This system aims to:

- Detect outbreaks early

- Support data-informed decision-making for communities and government

**📌 Current Status:**

🔧 Project scope is still being refined. Some research questions,
target features, and tools are not yet finalized.
