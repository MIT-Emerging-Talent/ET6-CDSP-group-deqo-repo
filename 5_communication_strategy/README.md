## Core Message (What We Want Them to Learn)

- **FGM kills**
  - If not during circumcision itself, it causes death shortly after ‚Äî
    through bleeding, infection, or sepsis.
- Survivors live with lifelong health consequences and deep psychological trauma.
- It affects not only women but also their children ‚Äî especially through higher
  risks of prolonged labor, birth asphyxia, and cesarean sections.
- **FGM is not required by religion.** Our bodies are not meant to be mutilated.
  This unnecessary trauma can be prevented.

## üéØ Why We Communicate This

- To save lives of mothers and children.
- To protect young women from lifelong trauma.

## How We Want Them to Act

- **Ideal Goal:** Criminalize FGM or create health policies against it.
- **Realistic Step Now:** Raise awareness in their own communities, influence
  cultural mindsets, and discourage FGM practices.
