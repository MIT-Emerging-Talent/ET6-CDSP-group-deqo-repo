# Project Constraints

This document outlines the key constraints that guide our data analysis
project, these constraints help define our scope, manage expectations,
and ensure ethical and effective project execution.

**Some boundaries around our project:**

## External

_These are constraints coming from outside the
team’s control:_

### Time Constraints

- Project timeline
- Inconsistent access to power and reliable internet may hinder communication
  and workflow
- Ongoing war-related circumstances in certain regions may disrupt regular participation
- Time zone differences across team members, limiting synchronous collaboration
and response times
  
### Data Constraints

- Use publicly available/ethically sourced data
- Anonymize sensitive/personal health data
- Scope manageable within project timelines
- Our project partner intended to provide clinic data, but it was not digitized and
  no details were shared
- As a result, we chose to rely on publicly available datasets instead

### Team Dynamics

- Initial waiting for partner input delayed progress, leading our
  team to take primary responsibility for project execution

## Internal: Involuntary

_Constraints from within the team,
not under direct control:_

- Team members have varying skill levels and domain expertise
- Limited and variable availability due to professional and personal commitments
- Our groups were merged late in the project timeline,
requiring us to restart much of the work from scratch

## Internal: Voluntary

_Constraints that the team decided on to help scope the project
They may include:_

### Workflow & Code Quality

- Coding style & conventions
- Agree on a code review checklist
- Number of hours to spend working
- All contributions must be made through assigned branches and reviewed via
open issues, then set up pull requests.

### Ethical Constraints

- Adhere to data privacy regulations
- Avoid bias in data selection and analysis
- Clearly acknowledge data sources
- Transparent about limitations/uncertainties

---
…So, these are the constraints shaping our journey. Challenges? Yes. Setbacks?
A few. But with a clear scope and a bit of perseverance (and caffeine), we’re
confident this project will come together, because _great work often thrives
within a little chaos._
